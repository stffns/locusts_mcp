# Feature Specification: Dynamic Multi-App Simulation Runner

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-m-building`  
**Created**: 2025-09-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I‚Äôm building a dinamical way to execute diferent simulation from different apps, environments and countries, should have good manage for errors no fallbacks if is not critically necesary"

## Execution Flow (main)

```text
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors (operators/automation), actions (run simulations), data (app/env/country parameters), constraints (robust error handling, avoid critical fallbacks)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### Primary User Story

As an operator, I need to dynamically run predefined simulations across multiple applications, environments (e.g., dev, staging, prod-like), and countries/markets by selecting parameters at runtime so that I can validate behavior and performance consistently without reconfiguring code for each context.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. Given a valid simulation definition, when the operator selects an application, environment, and country and starts a run, then the system executes the simulation with those parameters and produces results and a summary without errors.
2. Given partial or invalid parameters (e.g., unknown environment), when starting a run, then the system prevents execution, clearly explains what is invalid, and suggests available options.
3. Given a recoverable step failure during a run, when subsequent steps are still valid, then the system continues where safe, logs the failure, and marks the run as partially successful with detailed reasons.
4. Given a critical failure condition is detected (e.g., missing mandatory credentials or blocked endpoint), when starting or during a run, then the system halts that run, reports the critical failure, and avoids performing risky fallbacks.

### Edge Cases

- Unsupported combinations are shown as disabled with an explanation and suggested supported alternatives.
- Allow up to 2 concurrent runs per environment; additional runs are queued FIFO. (Configurable per environment.)
- Enforce a default max runtime of 30 minutes per run (configurable); on timeout, mark the run as timed out and stop remaining steps.
- Continue non-critical steps when some dependencies are unavailable; abort immediately if a critical dependency is unavailable, marking the run as failed-critical.

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to select a simulation and parameterize it by application, environment, and country before execution.
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate the selected parameters against a catalog of supported simulations and contexts and block execution on invalid combinations with actionable messages.
- **FR-003**: System MUST execute the simulation steps in the specified order, applying the chosen parameters to each step.
- **FR-004**: System MUST classify errors as recoverable vs critical and continue execution only for recoverable errors, recording partial success.
- **FR-005**: System MUST produce a run summary including parameters used, outcomes per step, error details, and overall status (success, partial, failed).
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide discoverability of available applications, environments, countries, and simulations.
- **FR-007**: System MUST support default parameters per simulation and allow runtime overrides with validation.
- **FR-008**: System MUST prevent implicit fallbacks for critical conditions (e.g., using a different environment automatically) and require explicit user choice.
- **FR-009**: System MUST log all validation and execution errors with severity (info, warning, error, critical) and timestamps.
- **FR-010**: System MUST expose clear messages for users to remediate common issues (e.g., missing credentials, unsupported market).
- **FR-011**: System MUST support cancellation of a running simulation with a clear stop state.
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide idempotent re-run capability using the same parameters for reproducibility.
- **FR-013**: System MUST allow configuration of non-critical step timeouts and retry counts per simulation.
- **FR-014**: System MUST support internationalization of user-facing messages for targeted countries. Initial languages: English and Spanish.
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide access controls restricting who can run simulations by environment. Roles: Viewer (view-only), Operator (can run in dev/staging), Admin (can run in prod-like and manage the catalog).

### Key Entities

- **Simulation**: A named scenario with ordered steps and default parameters; supported apps/environments/countries; criticality rules per step.
- **Context**: The triplet of application, environment, and country applied to a run.
- **Run**: An execution instance with parameters, start/end times, per-step results, overall status, and logs.
- **Catalog**: A registry of available simulations and their supported contexts.
